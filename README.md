# Guide for eBL project

The "Electronic Babylonian Literature" (eBL) project, led by [Prof Enrique Jiménez](https://www.assyriologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/jimenez/index.html) from Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU), involves the digital compilation and analysis of Babylonian texts using AI and computer vision technologies. This project leverages several advanced techniques to identify and match manuscript fragments.

The algorithms and techniques used in this project include:

- Image Matching and Fragment Identification: The eBL project uses computer vision techniques to digitally reconstruct cuneiform tablets from scattered fragments. This involves capturing high-resolution images of the fragments and using pattern recognition algorithms to identify matching pieces based on the cuneiform signs and their arrangement. This process is enhanced by custom-built software applications specifically designed for Assyriological research.

- N-gram Matching for Text Overlap: The project employs n-gram matching algorithms to identify overlapping text segments within the corpus of transliterated texts. This method involves breaking down the text into n-grams (substrings of n characters or words) and comparing these across different fragments to find overlaps that indicate they are parts of the same original document.

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Cuneiform: OCR technology adapted for cuneiform script is used to digitize and transliterate the texts from the high-resolution images of the tablets. This process involves training machine learning models to recognize and interpret the ancient script accurately.

- Machine Learning and AI: Advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the patterns and features of the cuneiform signs, facilitating the identification and classification of fragments. This helps in piecing together the fragmented texts and improving the accuracy of the digital reconstructions.

The project's GitHub repository provides access to the source code and tools developed for these purposes. The repository includes scripts and algorithms for image processing, n-gram matching, and other computational methods used to manage and analyze the vast corpus of Babylonian literature.
