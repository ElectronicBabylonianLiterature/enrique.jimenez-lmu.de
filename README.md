# Guide for eBL project


[Prof Enrique Jiménez](https://www.assyriologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/jimenez/index.html) and his team at Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) are utilizing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques to analyze and decipher ancient cuneiform inscriptions, including the Epic of Gilgamesh. They have developed several tools and algorithms to facilitate this process.

“It’s a tool that didn’t exist before, a huge database of fragments. We believe it can play a vital role in reconstructing Babylonian literature, allowing us to make much faster progress.” Aptly named the Fragmentarium, it is designed to piece together fragments of text using systematic, automated methods. The designers expect that the program will also be able to identify and transcribe photos of cuneiform scripts in the future. To date, thousands of additional cuneiform fragments have been photographed in collaboration with the [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection) in London and the Iraq Museum in Baghdad.

Prof Enrique Jimenez:

“Everybody will be able to play around with the Fragmentarium. There are thousands of fragments that have not yet been identified”

This project leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to read and match the texts. Specifically, they use OCR to convert the cuneiform signs from images into machine-readable text. Prof Enrique Jiménez's team then apply algorithms to detect and match overlapping segments of different manuscripts, aiding in the reconstruction of fragmented texts.
